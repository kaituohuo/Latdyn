Lattice dynamics with various semi-classical models

This project aims to create a versatile Python library that is capable of producing phonon band-structures using semi-classical vibration models, as well as other related calculations like specific heat, debye temperature, group velocity and etc. Semi-classical models are more computation efficient and suitable for large-systems like quantum dots and quantum wells, which initiated the creation of this project.

The author have created the Valence Force Field Model and the Adiabatic Bond-Charge Model for this Python library. These two models are capable of dealing with regular structures like simple cubic, face centre cube and hexagonal close pack. Ideal/Same length bonding is essential for these models to work (I admit this is a shortcoming). 

To be continued.
